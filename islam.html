                    <h1>What is Islam?</h1>
                    <p class="introtext">Islam is a monotheistic faith revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over 1,400 years ago.
                         The word "Islam" means "submission to the will of God," and it emphasizes peace, compassion, and justice.
                          Today, over 2 billion Muslims across the world follow this path, striving to live lives rooted in moral
                           clarity, spiritual devotion, and service to others.</p>
                    <p class="introtext">Muslims believe in one God (Allah), who is merciful, just, and all-powerful. They seek to
                         develop a close relationship with Him through acts of worship, righteous living, and care for creation. 
                         At its core, Islam is both a personal journey and a communal way of life, offering guidance for both spiritual 
                         and everyday matters.</p>
                    <p class="introtext">The foundation of a Muslim's practice lies in the <b>Five Pillars of Islam</b>—declarations and acts 
                        that shape the daily rhythm and lifelong commitments of a believer. These include the testimony of faith, 
                        prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p class="introtext">Equally essential are the <b>Six Articles of Faith</b>, which form the basis of Islamic belief:
                         belief in Allah, His angels, His revealed books, His prophets, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree.
                        Together, these pillars provide a comprehensive spiritual and ethical framework—grounding Muslims in their faith while encouraging compassion, discipline, and purpose in the world.</p>

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            
            <button class="accordion">What is the Quran?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct word of Allah as revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through the Angel Gabriel. It contains 114 chapters (surahs) and covers guidance for all aspects of life, including worship, morality, guidance for mankind, and law. The Quran has remained unchanged since its revelation over 1,400 years ago. There are millions of people around the world who have memorized the Quran in its entirety. The Quran is recited on a daily basis in the 5 daily prayers.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What do Muslims think of Jesus?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Muslims hold Jesus (Isa in Arabic) in high regard as one of the most important prophets sent by Allah. They believe he was born of the Virgin Mary through a miracle, performed miracles by Allah's permission, and delivered the Gospel. However, Muslims believe Jesus was a human prophet, not divine, and that he was not crucified but was raised to heaven by Allah. Muslims eagerly await his return before the Day of Judgment.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">How do Muslims pray?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Muslims pray five times daily: at dawn (Fajr), midday (Dhuhr), afternoon (Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and night (Isha). Before praying, Muslims perform ritual purification (wudu). Prayer involves specific movements including standing, bowing, and prostrating while reciting verses from the Quran and praising Allah. Muslims face the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca during prayer.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What is the difference between Islam and Christianity?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>While both religions worship the same God and share many prophets, there are key differences. Muslims believe in the strict oneness of God (Tawhid) without partners or trinity. They believe Muhammad ﷺ is the final prophet, and the Quran is the final revelation. Christians believe in the Trinity and that Jesus is divine. However, both faiths emphasize love, compassion, charity, and moral living.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What does Islam say about other religions?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Islam recognizes Christianity and Judaism as "People of the Book" (Ahl al-Kitab) and acknowledges their prophets and scriptures. The Quran states "there is no compulsion in religion" and emphasizes religious tolerance. Muslims are encouraged to be respectful and just in their dealings with people of all faiths, while maintaining their own beliefs and practices.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What is Jihad?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Jihad literally means "struggle" or "effort" in Arabic. The primary meaning is the internal spiritual struggle against one's own negative impulses and desires. When referring to physical struggle, Islamic law requires it to be defensive, proportionate, and conducted with strict rules protecting civilians, religious sites, and the environment. The greater jihad is always the internal struggle for spiritual improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">How can I learn more about Islam?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>You can start by reading the Quran, visiting a local mosque, speaking with Muslims in your community, or taking an introductory course.
