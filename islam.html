                    <h1>What is Islam?</h1>
                    <p class = "introtext">Islam is a monotheistic faith revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over 1,400 years ago.
                         The word "Islam" means “submission to the will of God,” and it emphasizes peace, compassion, and justice.
                          Today, over 1.9 billion Muslims across the world follow this path, striving to live lives rooted in moral
                           clarity, spiritual devotion, and service to others.</p>
                    <p class = "introtext">Muslims believe in one God (Allah), who is merciful, just, and all-powerful. They seek to
                         develop a close relationship with Him through acts of worship, righteous living, and care for creation. 
                         At its core, Islam is both a personal journey and a communal way of life, offering guidance for both spiritual 
                         and everyday matters.</p>
                    <p class = "introtext">The foundation of a Muslim's practice lies in the Five Pillars of Islam—declarations and acts 
                        that shape the daily rhythm and lifelong commitments of a believer. These include the testimony of faith, 
                        prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p class = "introtext">Equally essential are the Six Articles of Faith, which form the basis of Islamic belief:
                         belief in Allah, His angels, His revealed books, His prophets, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree.

                        Together, these pillars provide a comprehensive spiritual and ethical framework—grounding Muslims in their faith while encouraging compassion, discipline, and purpose in the world.</p>
