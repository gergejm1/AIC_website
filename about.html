                    <h1>About the Albanian American Moslem Society of Detroit</h1>
                    <p>Founded in 1945 by a group of Albanian immigrants, the first location for the Albanian American Moslem Society was a recently converted Armenian Church in Highland Park, Michigan,
                        They utilized that location up until 1963, when the Albanian Islamic Center in Harper Woods was established. 
                       The Albanian Islamic Center stands as a testament to the enduring faith and unity of the Albanian-American 
                        Muslim community. The Center officially opened its doors on November 3, 1963, becoming the 
                         the first permanent home for Albanian American Muslims in the United States.</p>
                        
                    <p>Designed by American architect Frank Beymer, the mosque features a distinctive Balkan 
                        Ottoman-style minaret and a copper-colored dome, reflecting the cultural heritage of its 
                        founders. </p>
                    
                    <p>Imam Vehbi Ismail was a visionary leader  
                        Under his leadership, the Center became a unifying space for worship, cultural preservation, and 
                        political advocacy—especially for religious freedom during Albania's communist era.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, the Albanian Islamic Center is led by Imam Shuajb Gerguri and continues to thrive as a center 
                        of Islamic learning, spiritual development, and cultural unity. Under his leadership, the Center has undergone a significant expansion nearly tripling its size to enhance accessibility, update interior spaces, 
                        and expand programming for youth and families.  The building now includes a large prayer hall, a fully equipped banquet facility, 
                        classrooms, a kitchen, a gymnasium, and administrative offices—serving both religious and cultural  community needs. </p>

                    <h1>Imam Vehbi Ismail</h1>
                    <p>Imam Vehbi Ismail (1919–2008) was a renowned Islamic scholar, author, and the long-serving 
                        spiritual leader of the Albanian Muslim community in North America. Born in Shkoder, 
                        Albania, he was the son of the Grand Mufti, Haji Ismail Alkovaj, and began his religious
                         education in Tirana before continuing at Al-Azhar University in Egypt, one of the most 
                         prestigious centers of Islamic learning in the world.</p>
                    <p>After World War II, due to the rise of Communism in Albania and the suppression of religion, 
                        Imam Ismail remained in exile and ultimately made his way to the United States. In 1949, 
                        he was invited by the Albanian Muslim community to lead and serve in their new home. 
                        For over 60 years he served the community faithfully.
                         With the Albanian
                        Islamic Center being founded in 1963, he became its first imam. </p>
                    <p>Imam Ismail authored/translated over 35 Islamic books.  His most famous work, <em>Muhammad, 
                        The Last Prophet</em>, has been translated into multiple languages. </p>
                    <p>Imam Ismail's legacy lives on in the Detroit community and beyond, as a symbol of faith, 
                        scholarship, and service to Albanian Muslims in America.</p>
