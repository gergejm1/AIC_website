                     <h1>About the Albanian Islamic Center</h1>
                    <p>Founded in 1962 by Imam Vehbi Ismail, the Albanian Islamic Center in Harper Woods, 
                        Michigan, stands as a testament to the enduring faith and unity of the Albanian-American 
                        Muslim community. The Center officially opened its doors on November 3, 1963, becoming the 
                        first permanent home for Albanian American Muslims in the United States.</p>
                        
    
                    <p>Designed by American architect Frank Beymer, the mosque features a distinctive Balkan 
                        Ottoman-style minaret and a copper-colored dome, reflecting the cultural heritage of its 
                        founders. The building includes a large prayer hall, a fully equipped banquet facility, 
                        classrooms, a kitchen, and administrative offices—serving both religious and community needs.</p>
                    

                    <p>Imam Vehbi Ismail was a visionary leader who laid the foundation for the Center. In 1949, he founded the 
                        Albanian American Moslem Society in Detroit, fostering both religious faith and Albanian identity. 
                        Under his leadership, the Center became a unifying space for worship, cultural preservation, and 
                        political advocacy—especially for religious freedom during Albania’s communist era.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Today, the Albanian Islamic Center is led by Imam Shuajb Gerguri and continues to thrive as a center 
                        of Islamic learning, spiritual development, and cultural unity. The Center serves not only the 
                        Albanian-American community but also Muslims from Kosovo, North Macedonia, and beyond. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>In recent years, the Center has undergone improvements to enhance accessibility, update interior spaces, 
                        and expand programming for youth and families. It remains a cornerstone of faith and identity, welcoming 
                        Muslims of all backgrounds to grow in deen, service, and community.</p>

                    <h1>Imam Vehbi Ismail</h1>
                        <p>Imam Vehbi Ismail (1919–2008) was a renowned Islamic scholar, author, and the long-serving 
                            spiritual leader of the Albanian Muslim community in North America. Born in Shkoder, 
                            Albania, he was the son of the Grand Mufti, Haji Ismail Alkovaj, and began his religious
                             education in Tirana before continuing at Al-Azhar University in Egypt, one of the most 
                             prestigious centers of Islamic learning in the world.</p>
                        <p>After World War II, due to the rise of Communism in Albania and the suppression of religion, 
                            Imam Ismail remained in exile and ultimately made his way to the United States. In 1949, 
                            he was invited by the Albanian Muslim community to lead and serve in their new home. With the Albanian
                            Islamic Center being founded in 1962, he became its first imam. For 
                            the next 46 years, the Sheikh would serve as the Center’s spiritual leader.</p>
                        <p>Imam Ismail authored over 35 Islamic books and translated many key texts into Arabic, 
                            Albanian, Turkish, and other languages. His most famous work, Muhammad, 
                            The Last Prophet, has been translated into multiple languages and remains widely 
                            used in Islamic studies around the world.</p>
        
                        <p>Imam Ismail’s legacy lives on in the Detroit community and beyond, as a symbol of faith, 
                            scholarship, and service to Albanian Muslims in America.</p>

                            Islamic scholar and the current imam of the Albanian Islamic Center in Harper Woods, Michigan. 
                            He completed his religious education at the Institute of Islamic Studies in Tirana and later

                            Under his leadership, the Center has expanded its programs to include youth education, community 
                            outreach, and interfaith dialogue. Imam Gerguri is known for his dedication to fostering a welcoming 
                            environment for Muslims from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                        <p>He has played a key role in promoting religious tolerance and understanding within the broader

            <p>Imam Vehbi Ismail, the founder and first imam, was a prominent Muslim leader,
                 scholar, and author of numerous books in both Albanian and English. 
                 A fervent Albanian patriot, he dedicated his life to advocating for religious freedom
                  and opposing communist rule in Albania. In 1996, upon Imam Ismail's retirement, 
                  Imam Shuajb Gerguri assumed the role of the Center's imam and continues to serve
